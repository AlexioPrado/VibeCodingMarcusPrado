# Game: SHAPE BLASTER
#### Yes, the name sounds ai generated but it's just me

## How the Game Works: PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING
- WASD/Arrow Keys: Move the player
- Left Click: Shoot bullets towards the location of the cursor
- Right Click: Create a turret on the location of the cursor

- Avoid enemies hitting you to survive
- You have a gun which holds 6 bullets
- Gain energy from defeating enemies
- Once the energy bar fills up, you can create a turret (Max 5 turrets)
- Turrets will automatically shoot at the nearest enemy in its range
- Turrets can be destroyed by enemies
- Place turrets close together, forming a triangle which allows them to synergize
   - synergy enhances bullet speed and allows them to heal themselves
   - it can create health packs to heal the player intermittently

## Contributions from me and AI
Gemini and I had such a toxic relationship which I couldn't handle. I asked for code and even asked for precise directions, however they could not achieve the standards I hope for my AI companions. Gemini helped me walk the first steps into creating the game, and even designed the look of the player and enemies. Nevertheless, I needed someone who could provide what I need.

Windsurf was the best companion I could ask for. She helped me write code and even provided me detailed explanations to what she has done. What's so good is that I could revert and changes she made and allow me to review and understand the code Windsurf and I(Really jsut windsurf) created. We had some tough arguments at the end where her suggestions were more like hinderences. It was a great experience to work with Windsurf, however, I'm ready to move on.

## What I'm proud of
The premise of the game was just sparks of ideas that appeared slowly which built up to what I have now. Sure, not good but also not bad.

## What I could Improve on
The limitations of the game was quick to notice as it couldn't sustain all the moving objects. I tried to decrease the lag of the game but it was not enough.
